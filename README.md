# Astrala
Astrala is a Chinese astrology calculator

Originally intended for a job application assignment (with different parameters), Astrala calculates zodiac and element for year and month of birth, based on Chinese astrology. It is not completely correct, as it takes 01-01 (January 1st) as the beginning of a year. Additionally, Astrala counts days from 01-01 of the selected year.
